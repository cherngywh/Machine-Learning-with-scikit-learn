# Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn

## Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to create a libiary of Machinie Learning algorithms which anyone can easily apply these Jupter Notebooks to their own dataset.

## Data Preparation for Machine Learning
- Dummy Encoding
- Label Encoding
- Train Test Split, Mean Squared Error(MSE) and R2
- Scaling and Normalization
- Complete Example of Data Cleaning

## Supervised Learning

### Regression for Value Prediction
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression

### Classification
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Complete Example of Decision Tree & Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
- Grid Search
